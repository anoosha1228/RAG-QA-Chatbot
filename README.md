# 🔍 RAG QA Chatbot

This project focuses on building an **Information Retriever** using Python. It demonstrates basic document loading, text splitting, and retrieval-based querying over local data using simple techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load documents from the local system
- Chunk documents into manageable pieces
- Perform question-answering or keyword-based retrieval
- Uses vector-based or lexical search (depending on implementation)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain
- FAISS or other retrieval tools
- Ollama / HuggingFace LLMs (optional)

---

## 📌 Notes

- This notebook is ideal for small-scale, local document retrieval.
- You may integrate with OpenAI/HuggingFace models for enhanced answers.
- Customize the chunk size and retrieval model as per your dataset.

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Open the notebook:
- jupyter notebook retriever.ipynb

2. Run cells step-by-step:
- Upload or load documents.
- Initialize retriever.
- Ask a query and retrieve relevant chunks or answers.
